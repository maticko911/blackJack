Python Blackjack Game

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game follows the traditional rules of Blackjack, where the player competes against the computer to reach a score of 21 or close to it without going over.

How to Play
Players start by depositing a minimum of $100 to begin the game.
Each round, both the player and the computer are dealt two cards initially.
The player can choose to draw another card or hold their current score.
The computer will draw cards automatically until reaching a score of 17 or higher.
Scores are calculated based on card values, with face cards worth 10 and aces worth 1 or 11, depending on the situation.
Win Conditions
A score of 21 with two cards results in a Blackjack and an instant win.
If the player or computer score goes over 21, they lose the round.
Wins and losses affect the playerâ€™s credits: winning adds 5 credits, and losing deducts 5 credits.
